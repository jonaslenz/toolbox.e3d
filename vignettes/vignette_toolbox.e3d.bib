	abstract = {The specific parameters of soil erosion models as resistance to erosion, hydraulic roughness etc., are usually determined by simulated rainfall experiments. Due to the required plot length of usually 22m, these experiments can only be carried out with an enormous effort of time and manpower. This study presents a runoff feeding device, which is able to multiply the plot length virtually by supplying sediment loaded runoff from upstream. Thus it is possible to restrict the plot length to 3m and nevertheless simulate flow conditions similar to those using standard plots. The described method has been already tested successfully under laboratory conditions (Parson et al., 1998; Römkens et al., 2001; Schmidt, 1996). In the present study, this method is used to determine input parameters for the soil loss and deposition model EROSION 2D/3D under field conditions. Based on the model parameters “skinfactor, soil resistance to erosion and surface roughness” the experimental approach is described exemplarily. The experimental results show that results from large-scale rainfall simulations with the plot's length of 22m can be reproduced successfully.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Version 1.1 of the editorial of Geoscientific Model Development (GMD),
published in 2015 (GMD Executive Editors, 2015), introduced clarifications to the policy on publication
of source code and input data for papers published in the journal. Three
years of working with this policy has revealed that it is necessary
to be more precise in the requirements of the policy and in the narrowness of
its exceptions. Furthermore, the previous policy was not specific in the
requirements for suitable archival locations. Best practice in code and
data archiving continues to develop and is far from universal among scientists. This has
resulted in many manuscripts requiring improvement in code
and data availability practice during the peer-review process. New
researchers continually start their professional lives, and it remains the case
that not all authors fully appreciate why code and data publication
is necessary. This editorial provides an opportunity to explain this in the context of GMD. The changes in the code and data policy are summarised as follows:
 The requirement for authors to publish source code, unless this
is impossible for reasons beyond their control, is clarified. The
minimum requirements are strengthened such that all model code must
be made accessible during the review process to the editor and to
potentially anonymous reviewers. Source code that can be made public
must be made public, and embargoes are not permitted. Identical
requirements exist for input data and model evaluation data sets in
the model experiment descriptions. The scope of the code and data required to be published is
described. In accordance with Copernicus' own data policy, we now
specifically strongly encourage all code and data used in any
analyses be made available. This will have particular relevance
for some model evaluation papers where editors may now strongly
request this material be made available. The requirements of suitable archival locations are specified, along
with the recommendation that Zenodo is often a good choice.
In addition, since the last editorial, an “Author contributions”
section must now be included in all manuscripts.},
